Dockerfile Command to Keep the Container Running
Here is a basic Dockerfile with an ENTRYPOINT that will keep on running without getting terminated.

FROM ubuntu:latest

ENTRYPOINT ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
Also, letâ€™s look at another 3 methods to keep the container running with the docker run command.

Method 1: You can use the -t (pseudo-tty) docker parameter to keep the container running.

docker run -d -t ubuntu
Method 2: You can run the container directly passing the tail command via arguments as shown below.

 docker run -d ubuntu tail -f /dev/null
Method 3: Another method is to execute a sleep command to infinity.

docker run -d ubuntu sleep infinity
Once you have the running container, you can attach the container to the terminal session using the exec parameter as shown below.

0ab99d8ab11c is the container ID

docker exec -it 0ab99d8ab11c /bin/bash
